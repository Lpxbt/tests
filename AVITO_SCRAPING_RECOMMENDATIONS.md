# Avito Scraping Recommendations

## Current Status

We've encountered an IP protection challenge from Avito.ru. The website is detecting our scraping attempts and showing a captcha challenge. This is a common anti-scraping measure used by websites to prevent automated data collection.

## Analysis of the Issue

When attempting to scrape Avito.ru, we received the following message:
```
Доступ ограничен: проблема с IP
```

This translates to "Access restricted: IP problem" and indicates that Avito has detected unusual traffic from our IP address.

## Recommended Solutions

### 1. Use a Proxy Rotation Service

To avoid IP bans, we recommend using a proxy rotation service. These services provide a pool of IP addresses that can be rotated for each request, making it harder for websites to detect and block scraping activities.

Recommended proxy services:
- **Bright Data (formerly Luminati)**: Enterprise-grade proxy network with residential IPs
- **Oxylabs**: Offers residential and datacenter proxies specifically for web scraping
- **SmartProxy**: Good balance of price and performance

### 2. Implement Captcha Solving

To handle captcha challenges, we can integrate with captcha solving services:
- **2Captcha**: Affordable human-powered captcha solving service
- **Anti-Captcha**: Similar to 2Captcha but with better API
- **hCaptcha Solver**: Specifically for hCaptcha (which Avito is using)

### 3. Consider Commercial Scraping Services

Instead of building and maintaining our own scraper, we could use commercial services that specialize in handling anti-scraping measures:
- **ScrapingBee**: Handles proxies, headless browsers, and CAPTCHAs
- **Apify**: Provides ready-made scrapers for popular websites
- **Zyte (formerly Scrapinghub)**: Enterprise-grade scraping platform

### 4. Alternative Data Sources

Consider alternative sources for commercial vehicle data:
- **Official Dealer APIs**: Many vehicle manufacturers provide APIs for their dealer networks
- **Public Vehicle Databases**: Some government agencies provide vehicle registration data
- **Partnerships with Data Providers**: Establish partnerships with companies that already have access to this data

## Implementation Plan

1. **Short-term Solution**: Use a proxy rotation service with our existing Playwright scraper
   - Implement proxy rotation
   - Add more sophisticated human-like behavior
   - Implement exponential backoff for retries

2. **Medium-term Solution**: Integrate with captcha solving services
   - Add support for hCaptcha solving
   - Implement session management to maintain authenticated sessions

3. **Long-term Solution**: Consider commercial scraping services or alternative data sources
   - Evaluate cost vs. benefit of commercial services
   - Explore partnerships with data providers

## Code Example for Proxy Integration

```python
# Example of integrating with a proxy service
async def initialize_browser(self):
    """Initialize the Playwright browser with proxy."""
    playwright = await async_playwright().start()
    
    # Get proxy from service
    proxy = await self.get_proxy_from_service()
    
    # Launch browser with proxy
    browser = await playwright.webkit.launch(
        headless=self.headless,
        proxy={
            "server": proxy["server"],
            "username": proxy["username"],
            "password": proxy["password"]
        }
    )
    
    # Create context with realistic viewport and user agent
    context = await browser.new_context(
        viewport={"width": 1920, "height": 1080},
        user_agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/16.5 Safari/605.1.15",
        locale="ru-RU"
    )
    
    return playwright, browser, context

async def get_proxy_from_service(self):
    """Get a proxy from a proxy service."""
    # This would be replaced with actual API calls to your proxy service
    return {
        "server": "http://proxy.example.com:8080",
        "username": "your_username",
        "password": "your_password"
    }
```

## Conclusion

Scraping Avito.ru is challenging due to their sophisticated anti-scraping measures. However, with the right approach and tools, it's possible to collect the data we need. We recommend starting with a proxy rotation service and gradually implementing more sophisticated solutions as needed.
